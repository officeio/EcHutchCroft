> *"This is the original story of magic, mystery, heroism, sadness, humour, and romance! 
The author has a gift for character development and there is plenty of action, humour, twists and turns alongside great descriptions of eerie, spooky locations. 
A story with depth and energy, a book that can be read alone or out loud. 
Thoroughly recommended."*
